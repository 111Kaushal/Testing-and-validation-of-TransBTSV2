You would find 2 models. The model with epoch 935 has better performance than the other but we have uploaded both anyways. The model was trained on Brats Dataset only for 1000 epoch. We utilized ASU agave cluster sumpercomputer after partially training on google colab and, we were only able to train for a limited time. You can train it on google colab however the process will take a long time if training on a free version. For more details please read the report and other documents and materials uploaded on this repository.
