Instructions:
This was graduate level project done at ASU. Hence the codes provided here are made to work in conjunction with the original repository or just seperate files that you can use. Think of it like a patch. Because of limitation in resources we did not have lot of memory to store the dataset. Hence we decided to compress the dataset and decompress it on the fly. Hence in som code files you may see some bz2 compression related code.
